          <h5>Personal Information</h5>
          <p>I truly believe Augustine’s words are true and if you look at history you know it is true. There are many
            people in the world with amazing talents who realize only a small percentage of their potential. We all know
            people who live this truth.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">Motivation is not an accident or something that someone else can give you — you are the only
            one with the power to motivate you. Motivation cannot be an external force, it must come from within as the
            natural product of your desire to achieve something and your belief that you are capable to succeed at your
            goal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 mb-4 mb-md-5">
          <h5>Use of User Information.</h5>
          <p>Positive pleasure-oriented goals are much more powerful motivators than negative fear-based ones. Although
            each is successful separately, the right combination of both is the most powerful motivational force known
            to humankind.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">Use a past defeat as a motivator. Remind yourself you have nowhere to go except.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 mb-4 mb-md-5">
          <h5>Disclosure of User Information.</h5>
          <p class="mb-0">The best way is to develop and follow a plan. Start with your goals in mind and then work
            backward to develop the plan. What steps are required to get you to the goals? Make the plan as detailed as
            possible. Try to visualize and then plan for, every possible setback. Commit the plan to paper and then keep
            it with you at all times. Review it regularly and ensure that every step takes you closer to your Vision and
            Goals. If the plan doesn’t support the vision then change it! So, how can we stay on course with all the
            distractions in our lives? Willpower is a good start, but it’s very difficult to stay on track simply
            through willpower.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h5>Is It Necessary?</h5>
          <p>The price is something not necessarily defined as financial. It could be time, effort, sacrifice, money or
            perhaps, something else. The point is that we must be fully aware of the price and be willing to pay it, if
            we want to have success.</p>
          <p>We all carry a lot of baggage, thanks to our upbringing. The majority of people carry with them, an entire
            series of self-limiting beliefs that will absolutely stop, and hold them back from, success. Things like
            “I’m not good enough”, “I’m not smart enough”, “I’m not lucky enough”, and the worst, “I’m not worthy” are
            but a few of the self-limiting beliefs I have encountered. We carry them with us like rocks in a knapsack,
            and then use them to sabotage our success. So, how twisted is that?</p>
          <p class="mb-0">This is perhaps the single biggest obstacle that all of us must overcome in order to be
            successful.</p>
